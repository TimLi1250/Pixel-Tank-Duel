# Pixel-Tank-Duel
This is our final project for Digital Systems: CPSC 348

1. Download Arduino-IDE, Download the three zip files in the Github and then Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library (we use the LCDWiki Libraries instead of more common ones like Adafruit libraries because we used an ILI9488 TFT SPI display)
2. The hardware is pretty simple, just remember we need to Voltage Drop the LCD screen from 5 V to 3.3 V, (the push buttons are just directly linked to a pin). A picture of the schematic is shown at tank_hardware.png
3. Finally, to run the program, just run the .ino file (the most recent version would be (tank_game_FINAL.ino)
