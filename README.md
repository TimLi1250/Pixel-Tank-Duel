This is our final project for Digital Systems: CPSC 348

1. Download Arduino-IDE, Download the three zip files in the Github and then Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library (we use the LCDWiki Libraries instead of more common ones like Adafruit libraries because we used a ili9488 TFT SPI display)
2. The hardware is pretty simple
